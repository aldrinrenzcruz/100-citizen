# 100 Citizen
 A simple text-based incremental game I made to learn JavaScript.

It's set in the future in a dystopian city where corruption is everywhere. You decide the fate of your character. Are you going to fight the corruption with good deeds or swim with it? Are you going to stand up against the syndicate politicians?

All for you to decide in 100 Citizen.
